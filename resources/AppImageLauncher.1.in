.SH NAME
AppImageLauncher \- Desktop integration helper for AppImages, for use by Linux distributions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
AppImageLauncher [PATH]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Helper application for Linux distributions serving as a
kind of "entry point" for running and integrating AppImages.

AppImage provides a way for upstream developers to provide
“native” binaries for Linux users just the same way they could
do for other operating systems. It allows for packaging applications
for any common Linux based operating system, e.g., Debian.
AppImages come with all dependencies that cannot be assumed
to be part of each target system in a recent enough version and
will run on most Linux distributions without further modifications.

AppImageLauncher makes your Linux desktop AppImage ready™.
You can integrate AppImages with a single mouse click, and manage
them from your application launcher. Install AppImageLauncher today
for your distribution and enjoy using AppImages as easy as never before!
